<strong>User Story #1:</strong> My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".

<strong>User Story #2:</strong> I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.

<strong>User Story #3:</strong> Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".

<strong>User Story #4:</strong> I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.

<strong>User Story #5:</strong> When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.

<strong>User Story #8:</strong> Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.

<strong>User Story #9:</strong> The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.

<strong>User Story #10:</strong> The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
